  Sometimes, your appâ€™s UX designer wants infinite scroll for one of your collection views when the data displayed is limited. When a user scrolls to the very end of the data set, the first piece of data reappears on screen; if the use scrolls the other way, the last piece of data reappears.Traditionally, the solution for an infinite UICollectionView is to have a large duplicated data set (for example, 1000 * original data set) to trick the user into believing the collection view is infinite. 
  But, a large duplicated data will inevitably introduce extra overhead by having a large amount of UICollectionViewLayoutAttributes. Besides, what if the user is bored to death and just sits there for a day to scroll your collection view? The chance for this to happen might be small, but, after all, having a large duplicated data set is not a very elegant solution.
  JWInfiniteCollectionView pads only a few extra duplicated items both at the start and end of your data set. In this way, it avoids the some overhead introduced by having a large duplicated data set.
